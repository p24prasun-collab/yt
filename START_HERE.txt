Welcome to GAIM 👋

To start the app (no technical steps):

1) Double‑click: Start GAIM.command
   - If you see a security prompt on macOS, right‑click the file → Open → Open.

2) Your browser will open automatically to the app.
   - If it doesn't: go to http://localhost:5173/influencers?g=male

3) When you’re done:
   - Go to the terminal window that opened and press Ctrl + C

One‑time setup (only if asked):
- You might need to enter your YouTube API key:
  1. Open the file named .env in the GAIM folder
  2. Paste your key like this:

  3. Save the file and double‑click Start GAIM.command again

That’s it. Enjoy! 🎉
